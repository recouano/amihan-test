# Algorithm Problems Overview

This README provides an overview of three common algorithm problems: Palindrome Pairs, Valid Parentheses, and Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS).

## 1. Palindrome Pairs

### Problem Description

Given a list of unique words, find all pairs of distinct indices (i, j) in the given list, so that the concatenation of the two words, i.e. words[i] + words[j] is a palindrome.

## 2. Valid Parentheses

### Problem Description

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid. An input string is valid if:

1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

## 3. Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)

### Problem Description

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence using dynamic programming.

## Instructions to Run the Code

1. This assumes that the machine has node and VSCode installed.
2. Open a terminal in VSCode. Hotkey is `Ctrl + Shift + ~` for Windows and `Ctrl + ~` for macOS.
3. Clone this repo in VSCode with the command `git clone https://github.com/recouano/amihan-test.git`

4. Type `node .\problem-set-#\name-of-file.js` on the terminal. The commands are as follows:
   - `node .\problem-set-1\palindromePairs.js`
   - `node .\problem-set-2\validParentheses.js`
   - `node .\problem-set-3\lengthOfLIS.js`
5. Press enter to run the code.
6. The results of the program are displayed on the console with corresponding test cases.
